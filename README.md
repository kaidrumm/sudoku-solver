# sudoku-solver
Algorithm to solve any valid 9x9 sudoku puzzle.

Input should be in the form of nine strings of digits and period, such as
".71.36.29" "4..7.2.5." "2.5.1...." "15.9....." ".2.1.3.9." ".....8.31" "....8.9.6" ".8.4.5..3" "31.62.84."

My algorithm will fill in the dots and print out a completed sudoku grid. (currently no special formatting for visual effects.)
