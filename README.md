# sudoku-solver
Algorithm to solve any valid 9x9 sudoku puzzle.

Input should be in the form of nine strings of digits and period, such as
".71.36.29" "4..7.2.5." "2.5.1...." "15.9....." ".2.1.3.9." ".....8.31" "....8.9.6" ".8.4.5..3" "31.62.84."

* git clone
* make
* ./sudoku [nine strings of sudoku board input]

My algorithm will fill in the dots and print out a completed sudoku grid.
